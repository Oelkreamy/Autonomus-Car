# Autonomous Car Project

Welcome to the Autonomous Car project repository. In this project, I leveraged my expertise in C programming and utilized Atmel Microchip Studio as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE), alongside the Atmega32 microcontroller. The primary objective of this project was to create a self-driving car capable of obstacle avoidance.

## Project Overview

The core components of this autonomous car project include:

1. **Atmega32 Microcontroller**: This microcontroller served as the brains of the self-driving car, executing the programmed logic for navigation and obstacle avoidance.

2. **Ultrasonic HC-SR04 Sensor**: An Ultrasonic sensor was integrated onto the servo motor axis. Its primary function was to detect obstacles in the car's path.

3. **Servo Motor**: The servo motor allowed for the precise positioning of the Ultrasonic sensor, enabling it to scan the environment effectively.

4. **Motor Driver (L293D)**: The L293D motor driver played a crucial role in controlling the car's motors, facilitating movement and direction changes.

5. **4WD RC Car Base**: The 4WD RC car served as the physical platform upon which this autonomous system was built.

## Functionality

The key functionalities of this autonomous car project are as follows:

1. **Obstacle Detection**: The Ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor continuously scans the car's surroundings for obstacles.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**: When an obstacle is detected, the car autonomously changes its direction to avoid collisions.

## How to Use

To explore and run this autonomous car project:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Ensure that you have the necessary hardware components, including the Atmega32 microcontroller, Ultrasonic sensor, Servo motor, L293D motor driver, and the 4WD RC car base.

2. **Programming**: Utilize Atmel Microchip Studio to upload the provided C programming code to the Atmega32 microcontroller.

3. **Power On**: Power on the system and observe the autonomous car's behavior as it navigates and avoids obstacles in its path.
